## Instructions

In this game you have a Player and Enemies. The purpose of the gamer is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down using his keyboard. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.

When a collision between the player and enemies does happen, the game restarts and the player is moved back to his initial position.

Only when the player has reached the water, the game is won.
